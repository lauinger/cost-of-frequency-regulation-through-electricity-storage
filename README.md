## Frequency Regulation with Storage: On Losses and Profits
This repository supplements the article "Frequency Regulation with Storage: On Losses and Profits" by Dirk Lauinger, Fran√ßois Vuille, and Daniel Kuhn, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2024.03.022 and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02987v2.pdf. This project was funded by the [Institut VEDECOM](https://www.vedecom.fr/).

The jupyter notebook `Case_study.ipynb` can be used to construct all figures in the manuscript. The notebook relies on frequency deviation data (`delta_10s.h5`), availability price data (`pa.h5`), delivery price data (`pd.h5`), and utility price data (`pb.h5`). The datafiles are available at https://zenodo.org/record/8014696.

The software used in this project was 
1. Python 3.8.8 64 bit and IPython 7.22.0,
2. JupyterLab 3.0.14.
